# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
  - I feel very good. It seemed intuitive and easy to get!
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  -It felt great! I didn't feel like I was struggling but more like the pieces were finally coming together and it all fell into place.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  -I want to explore more of the commands I can use with each. I'll probably go with ruby-doc and scroll around. Don't think I'll need to adjust much for timing.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  -Not really any burning questions but if I do I'll probably reach out to my group or surf the googles for something.
